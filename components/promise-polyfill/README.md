# promise-polyfill

An HTML import based polyfill for ES6 Promises based on
[taylorhikes/promise-polyfill](https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill).

**This library is deprecated.** Please see the following alternatives:

- If you already depend on the
  [webcomponentsjs](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs) polyfills
  version 1.0 or higher (as most Polymer users do), then you do not need a
  standalone Promise polyfill, because one is already included.

- If you need a standalone Promise polyfill, see
  [taylorhikes/promise-polyfill](https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill).
